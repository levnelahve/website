    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Account, Authentication & Personal Data</h2>
        <p>Scrollbye uses <strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> for authentication. The App only receives the following

            <li><strong>Email address</strong> — used to identify your account and deliver subscription entitlements.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note small">You remain in control of what Apple shares. If you choose Apple's "Hide My Email" option,
            Apple will provide a relay address — we will treat that relay address as your contact email for account
            purposes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Data Collection & Use — Short Summary</h2>
        <p>We do not collect personal data other than the email address provided by Sign in with Apple and limited
            purchase/entitlement information needed to grant subscription access. We do not collect analytics, location,
            contacts, camera, or other personal identifiers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

            applicable notification obligations under GDPR.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

            behavior.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>16. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, our liability for any claim arising out of or related to the App is limited

            not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
